## Brief
This repository contains a render graph I designed for use in two projects during my time studying at [BUas](https://www.buas.nl/).  
It's interface is designed to be user-friendly and readable, inspired by [Kajiya](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya/).

This repository only features a Vulkan back-end for PC, however I also made a PS5 back-end for the render graph.  
> I cannot share the PS5 back-end due to having signed an NDA.
